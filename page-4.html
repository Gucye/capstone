    <h3>Financing Strategies</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="title">Investment Environment</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">The external environment for the indie game industry is challenging; more than
      half of businesses fail to break even in the first five years, and many small studios have closed their doors due
      to a lack of competitiveness in China (Zhou, 2021). Although total capital invested in the industry has increased
      rapidly in recent years, the Matthew effect has become more pronounced: companies with a greater reputation are
      more easily financed and grow than those that receive little attention (Li, 2021). In light of these
      circumstances, I would advise novice game developers to apply for a game development job at a renowned game
      company's game department in order to build network resources, financial foundations, and insider knowledge before
      launching an indie game company. After three years working for a mature company, the game developer not only has
      the ability to start a gaming company from scratch, but also has access to capital at a lower cost due to the
      established personal network with potential gaming investors. Suggestions from previous indie game developers
      indicate that it is risky for a novice to invest the majority of his or her own money into a gaming company at an
      early stage, as most of the time the money does not pay off due to the industry's increased competition (Li,
      2021). I'll compare various methods of financing a start-up indie game company in the following sections, but it
      should be noted that it is not recommended for a novice game developer without external financial support to start
      an indie game company.</p>
    <p class="title m-top-20">Investors</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">At the beginning stage, angel investors and local banks are the most
      appropriate debtors. Because the capital requirement is not as large as it is during the growth stage, small cash
      inflows from bank loans with a lower cost of capital are preferred. Angel investors are less accessible but more
      appropriate because they can infuse the company with their knowledge, business network connections, opinions, and
      capital, and their required rate of return is typically reasonable due to their specialization in this field. For
      example, according to Qichacha (2021), Haoyue Network Technology Co., Ltd was financed by angel investors with a
      seed fund of approximately $5 million. It has successfully begun the third round of financing after three years
      after being provided with valuable growth suggestions.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">The following are the reasons why alternative financing methods are not
      recommended:
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">1. Personal loans are not recommended because they are too risky for the
      company founder, and the bank's collateral requirements are typically prohibitively high for an average game
      developer without significant personal capital reserves. Additionally, the loan limit is low.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">2. Crowdfunding is not recommended in China, particularly if the game's
      concept has not been censored yet. If the content or theme of the indie game is deemed inappropriate, crowd
      funding can easily be construed as illegal fundraising, resulting in legal consequences and a fine.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">3. The government fund is inaccessible to the majority of indie game
      developers, as current policy favors pure tech firms over game development firms. There are indeed tax reduction
      policies for indie game companies as well as rewards for those with a high profit margin, but there are a few
      authoritative funds dedicated to support game companies from the start.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">4. Venture capitalists are unlikely to fund an early-stage game company, as
      they are considered too risky for their portfolio.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">Apart from bank loans and funding from angel investors, indie game companies
      that are short on cash should consider outsourcing some of their work to fund their own project. Another option is
      to develop a simple commercial game rather than a creative indie game in order to raise enough money to fund the
      development of the indie game.
    </p>
    <p class="title m-top-20">Term Sheet Negotiations</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      Regarding term sheet negotiations during the investment process, I recommend that the indie company take a "rich"
      approach rather than a "king" approach, as the primary objective should be to successfully develop and deploy the
      game product, and a "king" approach ensures sufficient capital will be available throughout the process. Dividend
      and liquidation preference terms should be prioritized in this scenario. To ensure the game's smooth development
      and a high net profit retention rate, for example, the dividend payout ratio should be low, and investors should
      not have excessive liquidation preference rights. Nonetheless, board representation, antidilution clauses, and the
      right of first refusal may be compromised in part as a result, because venture capitalists are frequently more
      experienced in business operations, and having board representatives who are investors may result in a "win-win"
      situation for both parties, aligning the company's and investors' incentives. In an extreme case, investors could
      be considered "partners" in the business, which is why a partnership managerial structure works for a small
      percentage of existing indie game companies as well (while finding appropriate partners is harder than finding
      appropriate venture capitalists).
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      To address this issue, a dedicated CFO should be assigned the responsibility of negotiating with investors and
      providing accurate financial data in order to foster mutual understanding and trust. According to my prior
      experience working at a venture capital firm, investors in China typically require highly detailed industrial
      statistics, market potential estimations, how the company intends to fill a current gap, and the company's
      financial indices, particularly the profitability indices. To assist the CFO in securing external financing, the
      CEO should incorporate the CFO's recommendations when curating their business plans and developing their business
      strategies. The sooner an independent game developer incorporates financial targets into daily operations, the
      more likely it will be preferred by investors in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="title m-top-20">Exit Strategies</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      The exit strategy for an indie game company, specifically in China, is tricky, because usually the company could
      be sold by 20x multiple current market value of the company to the potential buyers, even if the company is not
      profitable yet. How could it be possible for a potential investor to buy an unprofitable company?
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      Many media magnates are trying to gain more share of the market, e.g., Netease, Tencent, Tiktok, etc. They are
      competing very hard and all want to secure a greater market share at the early developing stage, so out of
      strategic reason, media companies compete to buy unprofitable companies they think may have a bright future and
      they offer very high price to those indie game developers. At all events, these investors are not short in cash
      (Ken, 2022).
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      With this information, we should pursue a strategic buyout of the indie game company rather than an initial public
      offering, as the frequency of gaming firms going public in China has been decreasing for three years (Wang, 2020).
      If we want to establish an independent game company in China, our first priority should be to avoid growing into a
      gaming company magnate unless we have substantial financial resources or well-known IP rights for game adaptation
      (e.g., the game adaptation of the Harry Potter IP indeed makes an indie game company successful in 2021). Instead,
      the priority will always be to differentiate ourselves from other players, whether through more advanced game
      design or more innovative game concepts, as these factors will eventually attract institutional investors and
      strategic investors. Only with the assistance of a strategic investment buyer can an independent game developer
      acquire the necessary capital and human resources to develop more sophisticated game products, because small indie
      game companies don't have the resources to compete with large media companies.
