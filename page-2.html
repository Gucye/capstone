    <h3>Marketing Considerations</h3>

        <h4>Porter Five Forces</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Competitive rivalry.</p>
            <p class="txt-indent m-top-20 detail">There are already hundreds of players in this field, yet the market is
              far
              from
              saturation. Some
              successful examples with nearly one million players are Dungeon, Grow, Journey, and Light-Chaser. These
              indie games share the common feature that their operation team had little industrial experience, but the
              game designers are creative indie game veterans previously serving at the gaming department of large media
              companies (Qichacha, 2021). Entrepreneurs should expect a low to moderate level of rivalry because the
              industry is still a blue ocean with many players groping their way to success. However, it is still
              crucial to hone in the professional game development skills and far-reaching ideation process, because
              these are where the technology barriers can be built. The prior researches show a tax-reduction policy
              favorability towards gaming companies with self-developed source codes and frontier technologies, such as
              VR/AR utilization, indicating stronger competitiveness for game companies adopting high tech (Hu, 2021).

          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Supplier bargaining power.</p>
            <p class="txt-indent m-top-20 detail">It is hard to define an “upstream” in indie game industry. If we
              regard experienced game developers as “suppliers,” we should pay intensive attention to the hiring system.
              A promising salary level is insufficient to attract the talents, since larger holding companies with game
              industry department is always better financially backed up than small game development teams. To find
              experienced game designers, the company should actively seek for potential candidates among different
              gaming platforms. According to Wang (2020), there was a precedence that an indie game team persuaded a
              full-time state-owned enterprise employee to resign from his original position and joined the game
              development team, because this person had a long involvement in a famous game forum and shared his sharp
              observations about the industry. Entrepreneurs should expect a high level of supplier power, so efforts
              can be focused here.

          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Buyer bargaining power.</p>
            <p class="txt-indent m-top-20 detail">The buyer power is also of a high level within the industry as players
              can simply choose to play another game, and technically the development team has limited options to
              leverage it. One possible strategy would be setting a price discount to boost the initial sales, and
              leveling up the price gradually after positive feedback is gained. The maintenance and update of the game
              could be potentially required by customers, and details will be discussed in the following
              operation-related section.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Threat of substitution.</p>
            <p class="txt-indent m-top-20 detail">Currently, there is low threat of substitution, since many indie game
              players is fascinated with the free and explorative nature of the game instead of the mere action of
              “playing games” (Luo, 2019). This indicates that indie games have its specific target audience, and the
              competition in other specific game types is unlikely to influence the development of the indie game
              market.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Threat of new entrants.</p>
            <p class="txt-indent m-top-20 detail">The threat of new entrants is moderate, given that there indeed could
              be better ideas and designs scrambling for more market share, while the IP protection policies are being
              perfected and the creativity of a certain product can be protected from potential future appropriation.
              Many new entrants should be expected due to the growing nature of the industry, so it is crucial to have a
              clear business plan as early as possible to outperform others.

        <h4>4P Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Product.</p>
            <div class="detail">
              <p class="m-top-20">The following suggestions could help with the marketing process of the game
                products.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> i. The theme of the game should be differentiated from popular,
                main-stream online social games published by the game department of media magnates to avoid frontal
                conflicts. In other words, customers buy indie game not out of the need to realize the functions that
                big-scale online battling games can already provide. The theme should be carefully curated. For
                instance,
                based on the researches and my informational interviews, topics relevant to traditional Chinese culture
                become more welcomed within the market as they easily invoke people’s ethnicity pride. Jiangnan
                Baijingtu,
                a large-scale online social education simulation game, was popular for a time in 2019 due to its Chinese
                style background music and artistic designing. One potential example to explore could be Hanfu, a
                traditional Chinese cloth originally designed by people back in 1046 B.C. in China. These years, the
                sales
                of Hanfu boosted more than a hundred times, and a game with Hanfu being its theme could arouse the
                market’s interest easily.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> ii. According to Gamma Data, in 2020, among the top 100 categories of
                China’s mobile indie games, the
                revenue from strategy games accounted for 37.18%, and the sales of role-play games accounted for 11.35%.
                Entrepreneurs should decide a game type with a larger market potential based on historical data
                acquired.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> iii. Regarding the contents of the game, according to my point expert,
                many indie game try to
                incorporate
                popular memes or IPs into the games to generate selling points, and it is very effective. The idea of
                combing IP may boost sales is verified by the recent trendy game Harry Potter. The development team use
                the international IP to attract the already existed huge audience base, and the game’s social function
                of
                “studying in Hogwarts with friends” triggers more and more downloads. For entrepreneurs who have limited
                fund that buying and incorporating IP elements into games is unaffordable, incorporating traditional
                cultural elements, as suggested above, can work effectively as well.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> iv. One last point to mention about product is that companies’ management
                team should conduct
                continuous
                market analysis and keep collecting feedback from users to updated the game, and attempt to increase
                user
                viscosity through establishing a collection system in the game. When players are not so much attracted
                by
                the game anymore, they are loss-averse and are less likely to give the game up if they have already put
                many efforts into it and earned some virtual rewards and achievements.</p>

            <p class="m-top-20 title">Promotion.</p>
            <div class="detail">
              <p class="m-top-20">The following suggestions could help with the marketing process of the game products.
              </p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> i. Promotion should take advantage of social media platforms, and digital
                marketing has already become the most important approach for marketing, especially during the COVID
                pandemic. The game should be first delivered to indie game veterans to generate feedback and to make
                corresponding improvements, then the recommendation articles should be “bought” to be written and
                published online, and lastly, it should provoke a group effect within the target audience community
                through proper methods of marketing. Throughout the process, it is costly to sign contract with top
                gaming youtubers to promote the game, so the marketing should start as early as possible to maximize its
                influence. For example, if the theme of the game is Hanfu, then the advertisements should appear on many
                traditional culture forums as well as large-scale Comicons where the target audience are the most active
                participants. Through precise launching, group effect may be generates within the relatively flat
                audience network starting from a few group of “social hubs” or influencers.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20"> ii. In China specifically, gaming companies typically start promoting
                their game design ideas even if a demo has not been completed, it is a conventional action to take to
                avoid the potential disputes over copyright as well as to secure target audience’s attention and
                potential financing resources (GameRes, 2015). </p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">iii. It is suggested that focus group discussions should incorporate
                player-developers to get more constructive and practical advice, and appropriate compensation and
                rewards should be settled for early downloading or commenting of the game. According to the empirical
                discussions between experienced game developers, releasing a good trailer of a game can at least induce
                player to commit to impulse purchasing, serving as a “pull” strategy for customer to try the game
                (GameRes, 2015). </p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">iv. The company should not aim for profiting by posting external
                irrelevant advertisements. Although many indie games adopted this practice, the long-term return is
                minimal this way. Researches have shown that games with more advertisements lose their user viscosity
                more easily (Ken, 2021).</p>

          <li>
            <p class="m-top-20 title">Price.</p>
            <div class="detail">
              <p class="m-top-20">The price of the game is subject to change based on the nature of the game, the
                development costs, and the estimated pricing of competing products. However, two general strategies for
                pricing are: to find comparable companies and take reference of their pricing strategies; to set the
                price high at first to create an anchoring effect, then the lowering of the price will make customers
                think they have saved money instead of spending money.

            <div class="detail">
              <p class="m-top-20 m-top-20">The deployment of the game product should not be a big problem as the choices
                for the
                main application downloading platforms are limited. In this plan, I mainly refer indie game to those
                developed for mobile platforms.
              </p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">i. For inexperienced indie game developers, Android platform is preferred
                over the App store system, because the Apple places extra “taxes” on the virtual products published on
                App Store, leaving a narrower profit margin for game developers. Android platform, such as Yingyongbao,
                has a lower deployment barrier.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">ii. For game developers with prior industrial knowledge, App Store may be a
                good choice since all the products published there are more standardized and quality-guaranteed,
                compared to millions of games published in the Android platform. This action may serve as an indicator
                to investors that the game product is well-designed, and the positive signal may attract more financial
                resources.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">iii. The company should also think about their target audience. For
                instance, if the target audience is the student community who typically cannot afford to buy iPhone, the
                game should not be deployed on the iOS system.</p>
              <p class="txt-indent m-top-20">iv. For game developers who would like to develop PC console games,
                choosing Steam will be the safest
                way due to Steam’s existing huge customer base as well as its faster processing time for the game
                content examination and approval (Zhou, 2021).</p>
