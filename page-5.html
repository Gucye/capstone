    <h3>Projections and Analysis</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <img src="./images/img-1.png" alt="">
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">The preliminary estimations for financial statement estimations can be
      accessed here, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">It would also be helpful to conduct an activity-based costing model, in which
      the different sources of cash inflows and outflows are listed in detail for reference, and thus the budgeting
      process for the next auditing term will be smoothier. For example, if we can grab a sense on how much the SG&A
      (assuming 80% of SG&A is personnel wages) constitutes the overall operating expenses, by budgeting for SG&A for
      the next year we can also get an estimation for the overall financial pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">Another thing to note is that, in my projection, even if the discount rate is
      0%, the NPV is -$31,000. Hypothetically, the discount rate could be up to 20% in the indie game industry due to a
      high volatility in market demand (IndieNova, 2021.) This number could be justified since there is hardly profiting
      independent game company can break even in the first five years, given that magnates are competing hard in
      promoting games of their own. However, as we stated in the exit strategy part previously, the goal is not only to
      profit but also to stand out of hundreds of players to be seen by potential institutional buyers. Negative NPV is
      not necessarily a negative signal in the case for indie game companies.
    </p>
    <img class="m-top-20" src="./images/img-2.png" alt="">

    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">The valuations of indie game companies vary significantly due to the diversity
      of their products, capital requirements, and product development cycles. To quantitatively value an indie game
      company, one simplified and quick method is to estimate the future market potential and the market share the
      company can acquire. By multiplying the market potential by the market share, we can obtain a rough estimate of
      the company's value.

    <h3> Confusing Business Terms Explained</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="textarea">
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="15">
Operating Expense: An operating expense is an expense a business incurs through its normal business operations. Often abbreviated as OPEX, operating expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, step costs, and funds allocated for research and development.

SG&A: The category of selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) in a company's income statement includes all general and administrative expenses (G&A) as well as the direct and indirect selling expenses of the business. In fact, this line item includes nearly all business costs not directly attributable to making a product or performing a service. SG&A includes the costs of managing the company and the expenses of delivering its products or services.

NPV: Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project. NPV is the result of calculations used to find today’s value of a future stream of payments.
