    <h3>Managerial Considerations</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="title">Capital Structure</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">The capital structure of the company should not be too aggressive during the
      first years.
      That
      says, the debt to equity ratio should not be high, or the potential effect of financial distress will be
      considerate and the regular debt repayment activities will significantly hinder the rapid growth and valuable
      investments of the company. Additionally, taking too much debt will strongly impact the decision making process of
      future potential private investors, because equity holders typically get paid later than the debt holders during a
      liquidation activity. To explain it more in detail, if the company takes too much debt at first and gets financed
      from an investor A, when the company unfortunately goes bankruptcy later, the banks will get paid by the residual
      value of the company first, and investor A will risk to get compensated for nothing. In conclusion, entrepreneurs
      should aim for a D/E ratio of 1 to 2 at first.</p>


    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent"> However, when the operations of the company normalizes, higher leverage can
      be built to take advantages of the
      tax shield. However, any debt-related decision should be made after evaluation of how the potential investors may
      think of it. Based on my prior experience in the venture capital industry, private equity companies will also
      prefer companies that can provide detailed financial data and measurements, so if there is a specific financial
      personnel in the company or if there is a management team member with solid basic financial knowledge, the company
      will be preferred during the due diligence process. In the rare case when the company decides to take on
      additional external funding by transferring into a partnership structure, the leverage may be lower to reduce the
      discount risks for partners.</p>

    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent"> Another aspect of the capital structure that must be planned for early is the
      ESOP (employee stock options
      plan). To incentivize game developers to work harder, companies nowadays typically plan ahead for how much equity
      should be set aside to reward employees, particularly the developers and art designers who are critical members of
      the team. In this case, 10% of shares could be reserved for the compensation program, and this should be
      communicated clearly to external investors during the negotiation process.
    </p>
    <p class="title m-top-20">Organizational Structure</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">To begin, the company should establish a flat, decentralized organizational
      structure in order to reduce administrative time and facilitate collaboration between specialized personnel.
      Increased communication efficiency is critical for software development to ensure that design iterations run
      smoothly. One example of potential network effects is as follows: when marketing personnel provide the development
      team with information about a bug in the game's design, the development team promptly informs the product manager
      and frontend engineer via the flat network. Following that, an emergency meeting is convened with all pertinent
      personnel. With clearly defined tasks, a concurrent collaboration will occur, and the bug will be fixed.
    </p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">Additionally, the system should include a hub node. The hub should ideally be
      an executive manager with a strong grasp of the business development strategies. He, along with the CFO who is
      familiar with projected financials, will be responsible for keeping the company on track. Apart from these
      functions, a divisional corporation structure may be advantageous during the company's later stages of
      development. A suggested divisional structure is as follows: product&marketing, game development coding, art&music
      design, and financial&administrative. The horizontal layout facilitates communication between divisions and
      effectively eliminates inter-departmental competition. In terms of finance, the divisional structure is more
      transparent and persuasive to venture capitalists during the second or third round of financing.
    </p>
    <p class="title m-top-20">Managerial Structure</p>
    <p class="detail m-top-20 txt-indent">
      The managerial structure of current companies varies across the indie game industry, owing to the disparity in
      financial and operational support available at the start. If we are concentrating on a small game development team
      with limited resources, the sole proprietorship structure is recommended at the early stage. It assists in
      avoiding double taxation and the complicated corporate registration process, saving valuable time and cash flow
      for early-stage companies. After one or two years, the company should convert to a corporation for smoother
      financing rounds, as external investors or partners typically prefer a clear separation of equity in the term
      sheets. Additionally, investors typically require "collateral" or redemption clauses as backup guarantees for
      investments, which means that a corporation with standardized financial statements is the best option for securing
      potential investments by having everything organized. Finally, if the business intends to exit through a strategic
      buy-out, a corporation, as opposed to a partnership or sole proprietorship, will navigate the necessary legal
      processes more easily, as a corporation's information is more consolidated, if operated properly.
