    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p class="m-top-20 txt-indent">
      Given the huge market potential and the infusion of investments led by well-established
      institutions, the independent games ("indie games") industry is becoming a hot spot in the Chinese market. In
      contrast to the fact that more attention is brought in the market, few indie game start-ups can survive more than
      two years in China since they are typically under-financed, and there is not a comprehensive business guide for
      game companies about how to set marketing strategies, operational targets, and how to attract external financial
      supports.
    </p>
    <p class="m-top-20 txt-indent">
      This business plan will serve as a starting point for those game developers and entrepreneurs who would like to
      build a company from scratch. It will explain in detail why certain business practices should be adopted within
      the indie game industry and how to implement them. Some elusive business terms are illustrated separately if you
      have no business background to aid understanding.
